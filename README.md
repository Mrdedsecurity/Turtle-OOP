Overview
This repository contains a Java program implementing a simple graphics tool. The tool is built as a graphical application using the Java Swing and/or AWT classes. The software allows users to type in simple commands which cause a virtual pen (referred to as a "turtle" after the Logo programming language) to move around a virtual canvas area, drawing lines as it moves.

Features
Allows users to input commands to control the movement of the virtual pen.
Provides a virtual canvas area where the pen can draw lines.
Supports basic drawing commands such as moving forward, turning left or right, lifting the pen up or down, etc.
Implements a graphical interface using Java Swing and/or AWT classes.
Designed to be user-friendly and intuitive for users to interact with.

Installation
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
Open the project in your preferred Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
Compile and run the main Java file to start the graphics tool application.

Usage
Launch the application.
Use the command input area to type in commands for controlling the movement of the virtual pen.
Watch as the pen moves on the virtual canvas area, drawing lines according to the entered commands.
Experiment with different commands to create various shapes and patterns.

Example Commands
FD 50: Move the pen forward 50 units.
LT 90: Turn the pen left by 90 degrees.
RT 45: Turn the pen right by 45 degrees.
PU: Lift the pen up (stop drawing).
PD: Put the pen down (start drawing).
